##Project Notes
####BlackhawkUber
BlackhawkUber is a website I'm working on as a school project.

####MenuTemplate
MenuTemplate is a '.bat' file that turns the command prompt into a feature rich menu. Serving as a template, majority of menu items are blank, except for the intended items such as "toggle pointer".

####Renamer
Software is intended to reformat file names in a directory, so a name like "MyFileName" could be reformated into "My File Name". I still need rename the software to "File Name Formater" or something better.

####LoanAmortizationTable
Demonstrates use of ASP.

####GetStringLength
Simple console programe that accepts command line arguments.

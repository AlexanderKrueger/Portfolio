## Project Notes
#### BlackhawkUber
BlackhawkUber is a website I'm working on as a school project.

#### MenuTemplate
MenuTemplate is a '.bat' file that turns the command prompt into a feature rich menu. Serving as a template, majority of menu items are blank, except for the intended items such as "toggle pointer".

#### Renamer
Software is intended to reformat file names in a directory, so a name like "MyFileName" could be reformatted into "My File Name". I still need rename the software to "File Name Formatter" or something better.

#### LoanAmortizationTable
Demonstrates use of ASP.

#### GetStringLength
Simple console program that accepts command line arguments.
